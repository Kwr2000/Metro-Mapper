# Decisions

Design decisions and the owner's approvals, newest first. Each entry says what was decided,
why, and (for approvals) that the owner approved it in writing.

## 2026-10-22 — Phase 0 results (Claude; for owner approval)

Details and citations in `docs/SOURCES.md`.

- **Hays County is in v1.** Hays CAD publishes free monthly exports with market value, living
  area and year built. CC0 parcel shapes cover it (StratMap 2026, plus Hays County GIS). The
  Comptroller's 2024 study covers it (median level 1.00, COD 7.12), and zone layers exist for Hays
  CISD and Dripping Springs ISD. Its gaps (crime only at agency level, little fixed-route transit)
  are the same as Williamson's.
- **Parcel shapes:** StratMap 2026 (CC0) for all three counties as the baseline. Fresher
  county layers (Travis County's monthly TCAD layer, WCAD's daily parcels, Hays County GIS) are
  used once Q1 allows.
- **Williamson rolls come from WCAD's open-data portal** (Socrata API), not the certified-roll
  SharePoint links, which answered HTTP 401 from GitHub.
- **CapMetro GTFS from data.texas.gov** (`r4v4-vz24`). CapMetro's developer page points there and
  the feed is current (2026-10-07 to 2027-01-09). This replaces the earlier note that called that
  copy stale.
- **Crime:** APD block groups inside Austin PD's area; DPS agency-level elsewhere, labeled.
  No incident feeds found for other agencies.
- **Actions billing:** standard runners are free for public repos (GitHub docs, checked
  2026-10-22). The light-usage rules stay.
- **Validation targets** are set in `docs/PLAN.md` before any building.
- **Census API:** a key is required even for county-level requests. From GitHub it answered 503
  twice (with the key). Re-probe; fallback is the bulk summary files.

## Pending owner decisions

- **Q1. Publishing public government data that has no license** (TCAD/WCAD/Hays CAD exports,
  Travis/Hays County GIS, City of Austin GIS, district zone layers). Texas public records with
  disclaimers but no stated license. Options: (a) publish with attribution and each
  publisher's disclaimer, owner fields stripped; (b) ask each publisher first; (c) a mix:
  (a) for CAD and county/city data, (b) for district zone layers. **Claude recommends (c).**
- **Q2. TEA accountability ratings.** TEA's site policies require written permission to
  republish its content. Options: (a) email Copyrights@tea.texas.gov for permission (Claude
  drafts, owner sends) and link to TEA's pages until then; (b) link only; (c) publish the
  ratings as facts without asking. **Claude recommends (a).**
- **Q3. WCAD per-sale "sales ratios".** WCAD's open data includes a sales ratio for many sales,
  which together with the appraised value could reveal individual sale prices that Texas
  otherwise keeps private. Options: (a) don't use; (b) use only as area-level checks
  (e.g. median ratio by area with ≥ 30 sales), never per property; (c) use per property.
  **Claude recommends (b)**, after confirming with WCAD's layout what the ratio compares.

## 2026-10-22 — Source probe workflow (Phase 0)

- `tools/probe/probe.py` + `.github/workflows/probe.yml` (manual only). About 30 checks, one
  small request each: HEAD, byte ranges, count queries or a page fetch. Zip archives are
  inspected by reading only their directory, plus at most one small member (GTFS
  `feed_info.txt`). Output is counts, sizes, dates and status only — no personal data, since
  Actions logs in a public repo are public.
- Merged without CI: CI doesn't exist until Phase 1, and `workflow_dispatch` only works for
  workflows on the default branch. The script was syntax-checked and its zip reader was
  tested locally.

## 2026-10-22 — Owner approvals to start Phase 0

- **Phase 0 started** (owner: "Go", 2026-10-22). Phase 0 is discovery and verification, no
  app code.
- **One probe workflow and script allowed in Phase 0** (owner approved). Manual-only
  (`workflow_dispatch`), small requests or headers only, no bulk downloads, summary posted
  to the run page and as notice annotations.
- **Code license: MIT** (owner approved). Data keeps each publisher's terms.
- **Census API key:** the owner is adding it as the Actions secret `CENSUS_API_KEY`. Agents
  never sign up for services.
- **Austin Watch reference:** kept as `austin-watch-reference.zip` in the owner's Claude
  Project, never in this repo. Lessons and a reuse list are in
  `docs/reference/austin-watch-lessons.md`.

## 2026-10-22 — Docs-only PRs merge without CI

There is no CI yet, and the planned CI skips docs-only changes (`docs/**`, `**/*.md`). A
docs-only PR may merge after Claude's review against `AGENTS.md`. Any PR that changes code or
workflows needs green CI once CI exists.
